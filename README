Some very simple applescript to control Spotify without mouse clicking

Usage of spotify-terminal.applescript:
>> osascript spotify-terminal.applescript {command}

{command} can be:
   - toggle or t for toggle play state
   - next or n for play next song
   - prev or p for play previous song
   - stop or s for stop

This works best with adding global short cut key using QuickSilver or Alfred
